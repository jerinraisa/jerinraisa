### Hi! Nice to meet you 👋,

I’m Jerin (she/her), a perpetual developer and hobby enthusiast. I’ve been learning different ways to creatively express myself as a developer and taking it one day at a time.

During my downtime, I enjoy working on freelance projects in the form of portfolios, digital web applications, or fun, interactive experiences. When I’m away from the screen, I love reading novels, growing my plant collection, and sketching out random ideas.

**Currently I am:**
- Working @ Linktree as a SWE (!!)
- Catching up on my reading!

**Previously I was:**
- Studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I graduated in Oct 2023!
- Interning @teslamotors as a Frontend Engineering Intern 🏎️
- Many more!

### Hit Me Up 💫
