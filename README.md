### Hi! Nice to meet you 👋,

I’m Jerin (she/her), an enthusiastic developer when it comes to both my life and projects and a lover of challenges. I’ve been learning different ways to creatively express myself as a developer and taking it one day at a time.

I also enjoy working on freelance projects in the form of portfolios, digital web applications, or fun, interactive experiences.

**Currently I am:**
- Studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo
- Leading Waterloo’s Hyperloop Web Team
- Learning how to longboard 🛹
