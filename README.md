### Hi! Nice to meet you 👋,

I’m Jerin (she/her), a perpetual developer and hobby enthusiast. I’ve been learning different ways to creatively express myself as a developer and taking it one day at a time.

During my downtime, I enjoy working on freelance projects in the form of portfolios, digital web applications, or fun, interactive experiences. When I’m away from the screen, I love reading fictional novels, growing my plant collection, and sketching out random ideas.

**Currently I am:**
- Interning @1Password as a Junior Developer 👩🏻‍💻
- Studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo
- Growing my plant collection 🌱

**Previously I was:**
- Freelancing @Jam3 as a Developer 👩🏻‍💻
- Interning @Crowdlinker as a QA Analyst/Developer
- Mentoring UWaterloo's Hyperloop Development Team @waterloop

### Hit Me Up 💫
